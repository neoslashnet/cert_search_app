## 🚀 About the Project

This project was created to help users search for various cybersecurity certifications and explore relevant information about each. Inspired by the popular Security Certification Roadmap, it’s designed to be simple, sleek, and beginner-friendly. This was also my introduction to web development with Flask!

## 🖥️ Features

- **Search**: Instantly find certifications by typing in keywords.
- **Modern UI**: A dark-themed, card-based interface with a responsive design.
- **Detailed Results**: Each certification displays its name, description, and a link to learn more.
- **Data Sourcing**: Uses data sourced from the [Security Certification Roadmap](https://pauljerimy.com/security-certification-roadmap/).
